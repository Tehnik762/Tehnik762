# Anton Braslavskii 👷‍♂️💻🎸

Hey there! 👋 I'm Anton Braslavskii, a former construction engineer turned coder and music enthusiast. Here's a little about me:

## About Me

- 👷‍♂️ Formerly, I was a construction engineer with a track record of constructing houses, cottages, and even a factory. I love the art of building.

- 💻 Currently, I'm on a coding adventure, and my favorite languages are **PHP** and **Python**. I'm passionate about **web development**.

- 📚 Right now, I'm thrilled to be a student at **WBS School**, where I'm honing my skills to become a **Data Scientist**. Data is fascinating, and I'm excited to dive into its depths!

- 👨‍👩‍👧 I cherish my family, and they are my biggest source of inspiration and support.

- 🎵 Music is my muse. I enjoy both listening to music and creating it. I've even released my own music! Check out my [first album on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/33tHbaPhIOBGyqXGzHqGrP) 🎶.

- ✈️ I'm a travel enthusiast. Exploring new places, cultures, and cuisines is something that truly excites me.

- 🍽️ Foodie alert! I love to eat and, even more, I enjoy cooking delicious meals. Culinary experiments are my guilty pleasure.

- 💪 Crossfit is not just a workout for me; it's a way of life. I'm all about pushing boundaries and staying fit.

- 🎮 Gamers unite! I'm a fan of **Starcraft 2**, and I've spent countless hours strategizing and conquering in the gaming world.

- 😡 On the flip side, I strongly dislike working on weekends, dishonesty, and early mornings—unless I've been out all night before that early morning!

## Fun Fact
🎸 Did you know? I'm not just about coding and construction, I can also rock out on the guitar! 🎶
